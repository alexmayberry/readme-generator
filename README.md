  ## Project Description

  This is a simple command line based node app to generate a readme for your project.

  ## Video Walkthrough

  [![gif of my app demo](https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/c5acc03f1c904b0e9be308b84d61ae7e-with-play.gif)](https://www.loom.com/share/c5acc03f1c904b0e9be308b84d61ae7e)

  ## Installation

  Clone down the 'Readme Generator' project repo from my github. Once installed on your device, open the project folder in your favorite text editor. Then open an integrated terminal from the folder the index.js file is in. Type `npm i` to install all of the Inquirer library.

  ## Usage

  In that same integrated terminal, type `node index.js` and the return key to start the promt sequence. The app will run and display the first promt. Answer all of the questions. Once finished, a README.md (markdown) file should be generated in the same folder. You can then move or copy that .md file into your project folder.
